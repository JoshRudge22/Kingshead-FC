# King's Head FC
King's Head Fc is a 11 a side amateur football club that plays in the Warrington Sunday League. The website is set to target players who are looking for a team to join in the Warrington area.
The website includes images of the team both on and off the pitch, information about the club, how it all started and ways people can get in touch to either join or find out more information.
Here is the live link - https://joshrudge22.github.io/Kingshead-Fc/
# Audience
The purpose of this website is to help people who are looking at getting back into football. The aim of the website was to showcase what the team is like after games and to give them a quick view of how the team has been performing. I provide information about the club and if the user is still interested in joining give them information about how the user can contact us or how we can contact the user.
# Design
Background is a light blue on all pages as I believe the colour is easy on the eye and also goes well with the colour of the text. I’ve got for the white colour on my text on the images in the home page to make the text stand out and left the text black on the other pages as there is more detail about either the club or how to get in touch.
## Fonts
The Inter font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via Google Fonts. I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
## Images
All the images are from either live games or images that show off the clubs merchandise. Most of the images were taking by spectators who were at games or taken from the King's Head Fc social media accounts.

I have taken a screenshot of the result of each html page from validator.w3.org however when I either save of push a commit each html page adds a closing tag on each self closing tag. Example is my images the img tag will end up having a closing tag everytime I save the page.

I also used the following websites to test responsiveness:

[Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjoshrudge22.github.io%2FKingshead-Fc%2F)

[Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://joshrudge22.github.io/Kingshead-Fc/)


# resolved issues
During working on the website I felt like I lost a bit of control when working on the css page in terms of where I wanted certain things to be placed example being images I had a tough time figuring out how and where to place them on the pages. After speaking with my tutor, re-watching the code institute videos, reading the step by step guide on w3school and stack overflow I was finally able to style the pages the way I want to.

# unresolved issues
I had a tough time in getting a higher performance score in when I ran the pages by lighthouse. This was due to the images that I was using, the images were the reason for a low score and after the advice my mentor gave me to use the website tinypng this did increase the score a little bit. After reviewing the score lighthouse did advise to turn the images from a png to a webp which I did, once I changed the photos from png to webp and but the webp images on the tinypng did score did increase.
