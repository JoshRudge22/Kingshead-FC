      <h4><u>Who are King's Head Fc</u></h4>
      <p>
        Kings Head FC were formed back in July 2022, after signing up for
        Warrington Sunday League we were looking for sponsors to help fund the
        clubs kit, pitch etc. This is where the Kingshead pub came along and
        offered to help the team if we changed the teams name. Since then,
        KingsHead FC has been competing in Warrington's Sunday League.

        back enjoy free food the pub provide and watch any football games that
